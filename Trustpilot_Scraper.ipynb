Artificial Intelligence is the future. Whilst corporations may introduce legalisation and regulations in the future using the politicians they're funding, ChatGPT has shown us just a fraction of the possibilities AI can do to help humanity in general. Can it help you win the lottery? No. Can it automate tasks to make your life easier and better? Yes. The program uses existing data online to quickly and easily give you the information you needed. If you're not impressed with it, try giving it some queries on Excel functions and watch it almost instantly solve your problem. I've deducted 1 star, as unfortunately I have found about 1-2% of the information given wasn't accurate, and it appeared that it was so determined to give an answer, it made answers up in a few rare instances. I tried the Plus version, and that felt faster than the regular version, so no complaints, as they delivered what they advertised.

It is my understanding that the company is now under the control of Microxxxx and has shifted its focus towards profit, rather than serving the needs of its user base.As a long-time supporter of OpenAI, I am deeply disappointed by this turn of events. I had always appreciated the organization's commitment to providing open-source software that was accessible to all and was created with the needs of its users in mind. However, since the takeover by Other Company, there has been a clear shift away from these values, and the company now appears to prioritize profit above all else.This change has resulted in a marked decline in the quality of the software produced by OpenAI. The latest releases are riddled with bugs and are no longer as user-friendly as they once were. This is a clear indication that the company is no longer focused on serving the needs of its users but instead is more concerned with maximizing profits.Furthermore, I am deeply concerned about the lack of transparency surrounding the recent changes at OpenAI. It is unclear what led to the takeover by Microxxxx, and there has been little communication from the company about its plans going forward. As a user, I feel that I have been left in the dark, and my trust in the organization has been severely damaged.In light of these concerns, I am formally requesting that OpenAI take immediate steps to address these issues. I urge the company to refocus on its original values as an open-source, non-profit organization that prioritizes the needs of its users above all else. I also request that the company provide greater transparency regarding its plans and decision-making processes.\"}, {'review_name': 'Nicolas Raymond', 'review_score': 'Rated 5 out of 5 stars', 'review_title': 'Revolutionary', 'review_text': 'Much like photography revolutionized art back in the 19th Century, I believe DALL·E / Open AI has serious potential to do the same in this day and age. Initially put myself on the waiting list in June 2022, thinking it was worth trying out from all the hype out there. To be honest, I didn\\'t expect much more than another gimmicky graphic app that people get bored with over time with repetitive effects, but I was in for a very pleasant surprise. Now I\\'m addicted!As long as you know how to describe what type of image you want, DALL·E can render spectacular results. Far from being pigeon holed into producing a specific effect, you can dictate any number of criteria like subject matter, medium, art style, favorite artist, etc. The only limit (besides a generous keyword count) is your imagination.At this time, it is worth mentioning the resolution is pretty limited at around 1000 x 1000 pixels for the images DALL·E renders. I do however expect that to improve over time, especially as they are currently beta testing a new feature called \"outpainting\". Where you can upload an image starting with their limited resolution, but add frames outside of it where DALL·E will use AI to fill in the artistic blanks. Some trial and error involved, but it can render some great results with enough patience, and increase resolution in the process.If there\\'s one thing I can nitpick at, it\\'s the keyword filters. I understand the need for DALL·E to deliver safe content, and prohibits certain keywords to discourage explicit imagery of hate, violence, and sex among others. I applaud them for that. But there are some keywords I entered which resulted in unexpected warnings. A couple examples include Camille Pi$$arro as an impressionist painter, which I assume the DALL·E filter doesn\\'t like because of the word \"pi$$\" embedded in his name (incidentally misspelled with dollar signs here because Trustpilot doesn\\'t seem to like the word either). Or Emily Dickinson because of \"dick\" in her name. Even the word Ukraine is prohibited because of its current association with war, although other countries like the USA / America, Canada, France, and Italy are OK. These warnings are generated automatically, and could eventually result in a ban if the offending keywords are used too often. Fortunately I haven\\'t been banned yet, and I am learning in bits and pieces what is considered safe practice. But I do think some fine tuning is needed. DALL·E does a great job of using AI to generate some spectacular images, it only stands to reason their AI can differentiate between offensive keywords like \"pi$$\" or \"dick\" on a standalone basis, versus people\\'s names like Camille Pi$$arro or Emily Dickinson. That said, I still think DALL·E is top notch, and happy to give five full stars for how it can revolutionize art going forward.'}, {'review_name': 'JHuijsen Fietsenmaker', 'review_score': 'Rated 1 out of 5 stars', 'review_title': 'He is not intelligent nor initiative…', 'review_text': 'He is not intelligent nor initiative nor innovative.
