# Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) based on web-scraped OpenAI user reviews

This project involves the analysis of user reviews concerning OpenAI to understand their opinions and sentiment about the company and its products.

The repo contains the scripts to scrape OpenAI user reviews from Trustpilot and Product Hunt, two major product review websites.

The scraped data is saved in CSV format and analyzed through LDA. The results of the analysis are shown in an interactive HTML file.
