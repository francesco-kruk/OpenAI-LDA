### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) based on web-scraped OpenAI user reviews

This project involves the analysis of user reviews concerning OpenAI to understand their opinions and sentiment about the company and its products. The results were used to derive strategic recommendations for OpenAI as part of a counterfactual analysis for the course _"Industry and Competitive Analysis"_ at ETH Zurich.

This repository contains the scripts to scrape OpenAI user reviews from [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/) and [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/), two major product review websites. It also contains the scraped data in CSV format and the notebook to run the LDA. The results of the analysis are shown in an interactive HTML file (see screenshot below).
